I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Operations, Technology & Information Management in Johnson Graduate School of Management at [Cornell University](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/) (Chair), Prof. [Li Chen](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lc785/) and Prof. [Karan Girotra](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/kg488/).

I am broadly interested in unraveling the emerging challenges of the modern supply chains, focusing primarily on *risk management*, and *data-driven decision-making*. My approach involves developing theoretical analyses with validation through real-world industry data to enhance the practical relevance. My current work investigates the impact of data-driven decisions on contract performance and supply chain efficiency. 

**I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.** 

I will be presenting my job market paper at the upcoming 2023 INFORMS Annual Meeting, and I extend a warm invitation to you to attend my sessions:
  *	**Session TA28: October 17, 2023, 8 AM, CC-North 132A.**
