I obtained my PhD in Operations, Technology & Information Management in Johnson Graduate School of Management at [Cornell University](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/) (Chair), Prof. [Li Chen](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lc785/) (Co-chair) and Prof. [Karan Girotra](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/kg488/).

I am broadly interested in unraveling the emerging challenges of the modern supply chains, focusing primarily on *risk management* and *data-driven decision-making*. My approach involves developing theoretical analyses with validation through real-world industry data to enhance the practical relevance. My current work investigates the impact of data-driven decisions on contract performance and supply chain efficiency. 

**I will be joining the Operations and Business Analytics Department at the [Lundquist College of Business, University of Oregon](https://business.uoregon.edu) in Summer 2024!**
