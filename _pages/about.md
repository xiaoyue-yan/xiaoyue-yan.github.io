Iâ€™m an assistant professor of Operations and Business Analytics at the [Lundquist College of Business](https://business.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon. I am broadly interested in (1) unraveling the emerging challenges of the modern supply chains, focusing primarily on *risk management* and *data-driven decision-making*, as well as (2) advancing *data-driven sustainability*. See [here](/publications) for more about my research.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations, Technology & Information Management from the [Johnson Graduate School of Management](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu) at Cornell University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/), [Li Chen](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lc785/) and [Karan Girotra](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/kg488/).
