I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Operations, Technology & Information Management in Johnson Graduate School of Management at [Cornell University](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to work with [Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/), [Li Chen](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lc785/) and [Karan Girotra](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/kg488/).

My research interests focus on managing uncertainty in supply chains and understanding its implications for operational, financial and environmental performance. My current work explores data-driven decision making in multi-agent environments, with a particular focus on the impact of algorithmic competition on supply chain performance in the presence of vertical competition. 

I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.
